        <p>Additional Items are items that give you helpful powers like infinite saturation, regeneration, and speed, etc. (all of these have existed, but itâ€™s unknown if they have been added back yet). To find these Additional Items, you simply have to search for them around the islands. Often, they are hidden, or sometimes they are in the same place where you can trade your talismans and compress your items. Occasionally, they must be obtained by completing quests from NPCs. These NPCs will tell you exactly what you need to do.</p>
