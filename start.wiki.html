        <p>Here is a helpful guide to get started playing WorldsGen. The first thing you’ll want to do is head to the first island you see and locate a random generator. Generators are usually blocks that stand out on the island, and they drop items you’ll need to trade for gear and other essentials.</p>
        <p>Once you’ve collected items from the generators, go to a shopkeeper. A shopkeeper is an entity that trades your items for gear and other items. Use the items you’ve just gathered to make your first trade and obtain your initial gear, which can be a sword or armor—your choice!</p>
        <p>After that, you can continue upgrading your gear using the items you collect from generators. Eventually, you’ll encounter a trade that requires a compressed version of your items <a class="button" href="comp.html">here</a>. Once you’ve maxed out your gear, your next goal is to get a Talisman. There are hidden shopkeepers that sell these items. Visit <a class="button" href="talis.html">this link</a> to learn how to obtain a Talisman and what it does.</p>
        <p>Once you’ve completed all your gear on the first island, you’ll need to parkour to the next island and repeat the same process. Some islands will have entities called “Bosses” that will spawn. To learn how to handle them, check out this guide: <a class="button" href="bosses.html">here</a>.</p>
        <p>That about wraps up what you need to know to get started in WorldsGen! I also recommend reading <a class="button" href="weapons.html">this</a> and <a class="button" href="items.html">this</a>. And of course, if you have any more questions, feel free to ask a staff member. <3</p>
