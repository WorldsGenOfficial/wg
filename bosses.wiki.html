        <p>Bosses are entities that appear on a random island once you have progressed far enough. These entities can be quite easy but also very challenging. These bosses drop your items instead of generators doing so. To upgrade your gear, itâ€™s like every other island, but you need to kill the bosses to get your items.</p>
