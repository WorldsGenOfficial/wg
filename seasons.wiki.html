        <p>The Seasons of WorldsGen are basically a complete overhaul with new content added and everything revamped, but some things also stay. When a new season starts, all of your progress gets reset, meaning you will have to start over again. This is because seasons are a complete overhaul of the server, which means all of the gear will also be different, with updates like new enchants, new abilities, and entirely new features.</p>
        <p>There have currently been six seasons of WorldsGen, with Season 6 obviously being the newest. WorldsGen has changed a lot during these seasons, especially in Season 5, due to a higher-quality and more efficient staff team helping improve the server and making things better.</p>
